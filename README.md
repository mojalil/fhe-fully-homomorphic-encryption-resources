## Introduction
Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) is a form of encryption that allows computations to be performed on encrypted data without needing to decrypt it first. This preserves the privacy and security of the data throughout the computation process.

## Getting Started
### Beginner Guides
- **[Orochi Network's Beginner's Guide to FHE](https://orochi.network/fully-homomorphic-encryption-beginners-guide)**: An accessible introduction covering the basics, applications, and current research directions in FHE.
- **[LambdaClass Blog on FHE](https://blog.lambdaclass.com/introduction-to-fully-homomorphic-encryption)**: Detailed introduction to FHE, its history, key developments, and practical implementations.
- **[Sunscreen Tech Blog](https://blog.sunscreen.tech/intro-to-fully-homomorphic-encryption-for-engineers)**: A deep dive into FHE for engineers, discussing computational models and trade-offs between different FHE schemes.

## Practical Implementations
### Libraries and Tools
- **[HElib](https://github.com/homenc/HElib)**: An open-source software library that implements homomorphic encryption (HE).
- **[PALISADE](https://gitlab.com/palisade/palisade-release)**: A comprehensive open-source lattice cryptography library.
- **[SEAL](https://github.com/Microsoft/SEAL)**: Microsoft SEAL is an easy-to-use and powerful homomorphic encryption library.

### Tutorials and Examples
- **[Homomorphic Encryption Example](https://github.com/homenc/HElib/tree/master/examples)**: Example codes using the HElib library.
- **[Microsoft SEAL Examples](https://github.com/Microsoft/SEAL/tree/main/native/examples)**: Example codes and tutorials for Microsoft SEAL.

## Research and Development
### Key Papers and Articles
- **[Gentry's Original Paper on FHE](https://eprint.iacr.org/2009/616.pdf)**: The foundational paper by Craig Gentry that introduced the first practical FHE scheme.
- **[Homomorphic Encryption Standardization](https://homomorphicencryption.org/standard)**: Ongoing efforts and papers aimed at standardizing homomorphic encryption schemes.

### Current Research
- **[FHE.org Community](https://fhe.org)**: A hub for researchers and developers working on advancing FHE and other secure computation techniques.
- **[Sunscreen Tech Blog](https://blog.sunscreen.tech/intro-to-fully-homomorphic-encryption-for-engineers)**: Insights into the latest challenges and developments in FHE.
